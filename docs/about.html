        <h2> <strong>A Passion for The Arts</strong></h2>
        <p> Art in all its forms have always made me want to strive to understand and make them work for me. Creating…building… showing the world something new. Something there can only be one of and that one came from my abilities as an artist.
        </p>
        
        <p>At 17, along with a friend, I created a car detailing business. Starting in a small garage with only what we could afford, 1 year later, through marketing, hard work, and dedication, we moved to a proper shop with the best products, and became the most well known detailing business in our town. Any challenge big or small, I’m willing to take it on with confidence.
        </p>
        <p> In my role, I thrive on creative problem solving and come up with effective and innovative ideas for those I work with. Make sure to review my Digital Art Portfolio for examples of my work. I look forward to helping your business grow.
