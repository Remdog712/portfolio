        <h2>Website Comparison</h2>
      <p>Looking at the two websites.
        There isn't a clear "winner" on which website is better.
        The wordpress website is simple to use but also simple looking.
        No creative qualities and nothing to catch your eye. Meanwhile,
        the github website is incredibly complex to do small tasks but once you do those,
        you're left with a truly personal and creative website.
        To call one better than the other simply isn't true.
        I have to side with the github. It feels like "my baby."
        I've put a lot of time into coding, planning, and visualizing it before I could share it with the world,
        and now that I have the general setup,
        maintaining it isn't much more complex than it is to maintain the wordpress.
        I will leave my wordpress site as it stands because I truly enjoy the time and effort I have and will
        continue to put into the github site. Github doesn't offer a theme. You can't just pop your information on it.
        You build the theme. You customize it. You make it yours and I think that's where the importance lies.</p>

        <h2>Corpus Analysis Comparison</h2>
        <p>In my comparison of "Cinderella" and "Ash Maiden," I found many similiarites and many differences. The use of the slippers in both stories is quite prevelant, but the materials are different. Cinderella uses a glass slipper, while
        Ash Maiden uses a golden slipper. Both represent the 'glove that fits' but that difference in materials is unusual and may be simply a difference in what was considered beautiful in the times that they were made.
        Another notable difference would be the use of "joyous" words in the Disney adapatation with words like "oh" with the highest frequency of any other word at 104 uses. Cinderella uses other words like "singing." Which makes sense considering it's
        a Disney Film. Ash Maiden doesn't use these "joyous words" and instead tells a cut and dry story about the "Ash Maiden." The words: "Ash" and "Maiden" is the most frequent words used at 38 for "Maiden" and 28 for "Ash." For Ash Maiden being a short story, 
        the use of "Ash Maiden" is very high at 28 times. That's 56 words out of a total of 2,667. 2% of the words are "Ash Maiden." Meanwhile "Cinderella" is used only 74 times out of a total of 8,334 words. That's only 0.8% of the words. The variation is the amount
        of times the names are said could be due to the fact that Cinderella is a movie which provides visual reinforcment and Ash Maiden is only a short story so the names give the visual clues as to who is speaking or who is doing an action. 
        They are seperated by the times when they were produced and medium they were displayed in, but both texts tell a similar story of a lady with a slipper looking for a prince.
