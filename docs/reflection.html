        <h2>Website Comparison</h2>
      <p>Looking at the two websites.
        There isn't a clear "winner" on which website is better.
        The wordpress website is simple to use but also simple looking.
        No creative qualities and nothing to catch your eye. Meanwhile,
        the github website is incredibly complex to do small tasks but once you do those,
        you're left with a truly personal and creative website.
        To call one better than the other simply isn't true.
        I have to side with the github. It feels like "my baby."
        I've put a lot of time into coding, planning, and visualizing it before I could share it with the world,
        and now that I have the general setup,
        maintaining it isn't much more complex than it is to maintain the wordpress.
        I will leave my wordpress site as it stands because I truly enjoy the time and effort I have and will
        continue to put into the github site. Github doesn't offer a theme. You can't just pop your information on it.
        You build the theme. You customize it. You make it yours and I think that's where the importance lies.</p>
