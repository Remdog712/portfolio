        <h2> An analytical breakdown of the word usage between Disney's Cinderella and The Grimm Brothers: Ash Maiden</h2>
        <br>
        
        <p> <u> <a href="https://disneyprincess.fandom.com/wiki/Cinderella/Transcript">Disney's: <strong>Cinderella</strong></a></u> and <u> <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/52521/pg52521-images.html">The Grimm Brothers: <strong>Ash Maiden</strong> </a> </u> are fairy tales. Made from the same concepts, telling the same stories but with different choices of words. <br>
            
            Hence why many people know Cinderella but have no clue of the Ash Maiden. <br>
            
            <strong>HINT</strong> They're one in the same</p>

                <p>We can see that "Cinderella" and "(ash)Maiden" are the most prominent words<br>
                    The definition of "cinder" is "a small piece of partly burned coal or wood 
                    that has stopped giving off flames but still has combustible matter in it." 
                     and "ella" in certain languages denotes "feminine," 
                    so Cinder Ella would be the equivalent to Ash Maiden</p>

                    The context being that it's used as an almost joyous expression. Something you'd expect 
                from a children's movie/story and as well with "singing" at 34 uses, but Ash Maiden doesn't have many of
                 or if any of these joyous expression words. Simply telling a story without overly excited expressions. </p>

            <h2>The Analysis</h2>
            <p>In my comparison of "Cinderella" and "Ash Maiden," I found many similiarites and many differences. The use of the slippers in both stories is quite prevelant, but the materials are different. Cinderella uses a glass slipper, while
                Ash Maiden uses a golden slipper. Both represent the 'glove that fits' but that difference in materials is unusual and may be simply a difference in what was considered beautiful in the times that they were made.
                Another notable difference would be the use of "joyous" words in the Disney adapatation with words like "oh" with the highest frequency of any other word at 104 uses. Cinderella uses other words like "singing." Which makes sense considering it's
                a Disney Film. Ash Maiden doesn't use these "joyous words" and instead tells a cut and dry story about the "Ash Maiden." The words: "Ash" and "Maiden" is the most frequent words used at 38 for "Maiden" and 28 for "Ash." For Ash Maiden being a short story, 
                the use of "Ash Maiden" is very high at 28 times. That's 56 words out of a total of 2,667. 2% of the words are "Ash Maiden." Meanwhile "Cinderella" is used only 74 times out of a total of 8,334 words. That's only 0.8% of the words. The variation is the amount
                of times the names are said could be due to the fact that Cinderella is a movie which provides visual reinforcment and Ash Maiden is only a short story so the names give the visual clues as to who is speaking or who is doing an action. 
                They are seperated by the times when they were produced and medium they were displayed in, but both texts tell a similar story of a lady with a slipper looking for a prince. </p>
